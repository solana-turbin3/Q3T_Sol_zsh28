- **Betting**: Users can place bets on sports events, choosing outcomes such as Team A, Team B, or a draw.
- **Event Resolution**: Once a sports event concludes, the admin can resolve the event by determining the winning outcome.

- **Admin Controls**: Admins have the ability to delete events after ensuring all rewards have been claimed.
  
## Smart Contract Overview

### `lib.rs`

This is the entry point to the program, where modules and external dependencies are declared. The `sports_hub` program includes multiple instructions to manage sports events and bets.

### Key Instructions

2. **Create Event**: Creates a new sports event with details fetched from the FPL (Fantasy Premier League) API.
3. **Place Bet**: Allows users to place bets on the outcome of a sports event. Bets can be placed on Team A, Team B, or a draw.
4. **Resolve Event**: Resolves an event by setting the winning outcome, which determines the users who won the bet.
5. **Distribute Rewards**: Handles the reward distribution to winning participants, deducting a platform fee before distributing winnings.
6. **Delete Event**: Admins can delete events, but only if the event has been resolved and all rewards have been claimed.

### State Structures

- **Event**: Represents a sports event, including teams, start time, total bets, outcome details, and resolution status.
- **Bet**: Represents a bet placed by a user on an event, storing the userâ€™s details, bet amount, and outcome choice.
- **PlayerStats**: Tracks the total bets placed and winnings for each player on the platform.

### Program Flow

1. **Initialize**: Set up the vault to manage SOL funds for bets.
2. **Create Event**: Admins initialize a sports event, passing in relevant information.
3. **Place Bet**: Users place their bets by choosing an outcome and transferring SOL to the vault.
4. **Resolve Event**: The event is resolved by the admin, and the winning outcome is recorded.
5. **Distribute Rewards**: After the event is resolved, winnings are distributed to users who bet on the correct outcome.
6. **Delete Event**: Once all rewards have been claimed, the event and associated bet accounts are deleted.

### Error Handling

The program uses custom errors to handle conditions like invalid event IDs, insufficient funds, invalid outcomes, and unresolved events. Key error scenarios include:

- **InvalidEvent**: Thrown when an event ID does not match.
- **EventAlreadyResolved**: Thrown when trying to resolve an already-resolved event.
- **BettingClosed**: Thrown when users attempt to bet after the event's start time.
